# Random-TCP-Segmentation

A Python script implements the random segmentation algorithm from the paper "Random Segmentation: New Traffic Obfuscation Against Packet-Size based Side-Channel Attacks."

Environment: Python 3.10.11

The server.py listens on port 7000 and reports the amount of data received, while client.py sends a byte stream of 10 MB. Before running the code, input the corresponding server address according to the network settings. Example: Server_IP = '192.175.826.1'.
